        <li><strong>FR-09:</strong> App MUST auto-fetch AQI using OpenWeatherMap API based on GPS permission.</li>
        <li><strong>FR-10:</strong> App MUST support "Offline Mode" - allowing users to track data without internet, syncing when connection is restored.</li>
    </ul>

    <h4>2.1.4 AI Insights & Reports</h4>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>FR-11:</strong> System MUST generate a daily "Health Score" based on tracked metrics.</li>
        <li><strong>FR-12:</strong> System MUST display "Nudges" (Notifications/In-app cards) triggered by logic (e.g., if Water < 2L -> "Hydrate now").</li>
        <li><strong>FR-13:</strong> Reports MUST use traffic light colors (Green=Good, Yellow=Caution, Red=Danger) for universal understanding.</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>2.2 Non-Functional Requirements (NFR)</h3>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>NFR-01 (Usability):</strong> UI elements MUST be large and touch-friendly (min 44x44pt targets). Text MUST be concise. Icons MUST be used alongside text for all major actions (for low-literacy support).</li>

    <h2>3. User Stories (For Agile Development)</h2>

    <h3>Epic 1: Onboarding & First Impressions</h3>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>US-1.1:</strong> As a <strong>Hindi-speaking user</strong>, I want to <strong>select my language on the first screen</strong>, so that I can understand the rest of the app setup.</li>
        <li><strong>US-1.2:</strong> As a <strong>user</strong>, I want to <strong>login via OTP</strong>, so that I don't have to remember complex passwords.</li>
        <li><strong>US-1.3:</strong> As a <strong>new user</strong>, I want to <strong>complete a quick health quiz</strong>, so that the app knows my baseline health risks immediately.</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Epic 2: Daily Tracking (The Core Loop)</h3>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>US-2.1:</strong> As a <strong>busy professional</strong>, I want to <strong>log my water intake with one tap</strong>, so that I don't waste time typing.</li>
        <li><strong>US-2.2:</strong> As a <strong>user in Delhi</strong>, I want to <strong>see the current AQI automatically</strong>, so I know if I should wear a mask.</li>
        <li><strong>US-2.3:</strong> As a <strong>user</strong>, I want to <strong>see a red warning if my screen time is too high</strong>, so I am reminded to take a break.</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Epic 3: Insights & Retention</h3>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>US-3.1:</strong> As a <strong>user</strong>, I want to <strong>see a simple "Health Score" (e.g., 85/100)</strong>, so I know how well I did today at a glance.</li>
        <li><strong>US-3.2:</strong> As a <strong>user</strong>, I want to <strong>receive a notification to drink water</strong>, but only if I haven't logged enough water by 2 PM.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>4. UI/UX Guidelines for "Education-Agnostic" Design</h2>
    <ol>
        <li><strong>Voice & Tone:</strong> Empathetic, encouraging, and simple. Avoid medical jargon (Use "Eye Strain" instead of "Computer Vision Syndrome").</li>
        <li><strong>Visuals:</strong> Use illustrations for every category (e.g., a Glass icon for water, a Bed icon for sleep).</li>
        <li><strong>Color Semantics:</strong> Strictly adhere to Green/Orange/Red for status. Do not use these colors for decoration to avoid confusion.</li>
        <li><strong>Navigation:</strong> Bottom Tab Bar with max 4 tabs: <strong>Home</strong> (Tracker), <strong>Report</strong> (Analysis), <strong>Learn</strong> (Tips), <strong>Profile</strong>.</li>
    </ol>
